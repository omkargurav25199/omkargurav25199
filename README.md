I am an Software Engineer and a Graduate Student in Computer Science at Pace University, where I focus on software development and Artificial Intelligence applications to real-world challenges. I have a strong interest in software engineering and machine learning.

👨‍💼 Previously, I worked at Accenture as an Application Development Associate, I worked on data migration projects where optimized data loading and transformation speed by 60% using PL-SQL scripts to deliver metadata aligning with business needs. I also Developed data migration ODI mappings to improve speed by 30% over the data sets of 70 million entries and to automate a suite of tasks on the server to minimize time by 35% and to resolve faults easily.

📚 I have multiple Projects and certification in data science, Machine learning and software engineering, and I am proficient in Python, SQL, JAVA, C++, and Web technologies like HTML, CSS, Javascript . I use tools such as Tableau, Jupyter, MySQL, VS Code, MATLAB, and Anaconda to craft robust, efficient solutions.

📝 Additionally, my talent in mobile robotics has been recognized globally. I won a medallion of excellence at WorldSkills Kazan 2019 in Mobile Robotics and was shortlisted for MIT GRANDHACK 2020 at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. As a Silver Medallist in Mobile Robotics at India Skills 2018 and a member of Team India at WorldSkills Asia 2018 held in Abu Dhabi, I have gained valuable experience and skills in the field of robotics.I also have a research paper published in IEEE on the topic "Industrial Automation using SLAM" .

🚀 I am always eager to learn new skills and stay updated on the latest trends in Software Development and AI . I enjoy collaborating with other professionals and researchers to harness the power of AI for innovative solutions. I am looking for opportunities to apply my skills and knowledge to real-world problems and make a positive impact.
